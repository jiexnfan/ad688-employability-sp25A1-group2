Literature summary:
1. Cheung et al. (2023) - Local Impacts of Remote Work
	Cheung et al. focus on the urban-level consequences of remote work, using Auckland, New Zealand as a case study. Leveraging location-based services (LBS) and mobile data, the authors track post-pandemic shifts in workplace geography. Their standout finding is that over half (54.5%) of workers moved away from the Central Business District (CBD), signaling a decentralization of labor and a decline in traditional urban commuting patterns.
	This behavioral shift has implications for local economies: reduced demand for office space, changes in retail foot traffic, and a reconfiguration of urban infrastructure. The study's use of real-time data and machine learning to infer workplace transitions offers a methodological blueprint for your team's own analysis. It validates the idea that remote work is not just a labor trend - it's a spatial redistribution mechanism, reshaping cities from the ground up.
	
2. Althoff et al. (2022) - National Labor Market Shifts
	Althoff et al. scale the conversation to the national level, analyzing how remote work affects different occupational groups across U.S. cities. Their key insight is that remote work disproportionately benefits high-skill business service workers, who tend to cluster in dense urban areas. In contrast, consumer service workers suffer due to reduced local demand, leading to wage and employment declines.
	The authors extend the Rosen-Roback spatial equilibrium model to show how remote work decouples productivity from physical location. This theoretical contribution is crucial: it reframes remote work as a force that disrupts traditional labor geography, enabling talent to concentrate while leaving service economies behind.

3. Braesemann et al. (2022) - Global Polarization of Remote Work
	Braesemann et al. take the analysis global, examining 1.8 million remote jobs across 139 countries. Their central finding is that remote work is polarized by geography, skill, and infrastructure. Most remote jobs are concentrated in the Global North, especially in urban centers with robust digital ecosystems. Meanwhile, workers in the Global South - even those with advanced skills - face barriers due to weaker infrastructure and platform access. The study uses platform data and occupational taxonomies to map global disparities, revealing that remote work amplifies existing inequalities rather than leveling the playing field.

How it relates to our project:
1.   Local (Cheung et al.): Urban decentralization and behavioral shifts. For our project, Cheung et al. provide a micro-level (urban/rural) lens to understand how remote work has multi-layered effects that affect local consumption, mobility, and even urban planning. Their findings support hypotheses around suburbanization as well as the decline of centralized work hubs--which for the purpose of our project, we could compare to our case living and attempting to find work around the "Greater-Boston" area.

2. National (Althoff et al.): Occupational divergence and spatial equilibrium disruption. For our team, this article offers a nice and structural framework to analyze remote work's uneven impact across sectors and regions. As it supports our exploration of urban-to-suburban migration and also helps quantify the economic divergence between mobile (remote/flex/hybrid) and immobile (onsite) labor forces.

3. International (Braesemann et al.): Infrastructure-driven polarization and skill-based inequality. Now this particular article is a literal goldmine for our research--and was by far the most holistic and robust article from the bunch. For our project this article provides a macro-level (global) context to situate U.S. trends within a broader global narrative and it reinforces the importance of digital infrastructure and skill segmentation in shaping remote work opportunities. Which is the reason we are all here, attempting to differentiate ourselves from our peers and competitors in the job-market

Together, these articles form a multi-layer foundation for our "geographic" and "remote work" analysis that literally spans from city blocks, to global labor flows... so please feel free to review them, and expand further on any of the points.
