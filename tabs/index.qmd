## Project Overview

This project investigates how geography and remote work shape employment opportunities in today's evolving job market. The rise of remote and hybrid work models, driven by technological advances and accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has reshaped where people work, how companies hire, and which regions are experiencing growth or decline.

Our analysis explores:

- Geographic distribution of AI vs. non-AI job postings  
- Differences in job availability across U.S. regions  
- The role of remote, hybrid, and onsite work arrangements  
- How location influences accessibility to high-paying job opportunities  

The goal of this project is to understand how geography, work modality, and industry characteristics interact to shape employability and job market equity in 2024.
