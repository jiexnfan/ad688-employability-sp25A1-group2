## Project Overview

This project investigates how geography and remote work shape employment opportunities in today's evolving job market. The rise of remote and hybrid work models, driven by technological advances and accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has reshaped where people work, how companies hire, and which regions are experiencing growth or decline.

Our analysis explores:

- Geographic distribution of AI vs. non-AI job postings  
- Differences in job availability across U.S. regions  
- The role of remote, hybrid, and onsite work arrangements  
- How location influences accessibility to high-paying job opportunities  

The goal of this project is to understand how geography, work modality, and industry characteristics interact to shape employability and job market equity in 2024.

## What This Report Includes

- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Machine learning methods for job classification  
- Geographic and remote-work insights  
- Team skill gap analysis  

This report serves as the compiled final submission for MET AD688: Cloud Analytics for Business.


# Introduction
## Introduction and Research Rationale

Understanding the relationship between geography and remote work has become crucial for analyzing the modern labor market. In recent years, the geography of employment has undergone a fundamental transformation driven by digitalization, AI-enabled work processes, and the normalization of remote and hybrid work models. These shifts have redefined how workers access opportunities, how companies allocate talent, and how cities compete for economic activity.

### Why Geography Matters

Remote work has weakened the traditional link between physical location and job accessibility. High-income and high-skill workers, in particular, have increasingly gained the ability to work from anywhere, widening regional differences in both job creation and income distribution. At the same time, industries requiring physical presence—such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics—continue to show limited remote adoption, reinforcing geographic constraints.

### Evidence from Recent Research

Recent empirical studies highlight how the geography of work is shifting:

- **Work-from-home reshaping urban patterns:** Cheung, Chuang, & Yiu (2023) used location-based service data to show how workplaces in New Zealand became more spatially dispersed after COVID-19, illustrating a structural shift in where work occurs.  
- **Talent leaving major cities:** Althoff, Eckert, Ganapati, & Walsh (2022) found that high-income business service workers in the United States were early adopters of remote work, driving consumer demand away from large metropolitan centers.  
- **Global inequality in remote opportunities:** Braesemann et al. (2022) showed that remote work access is uneven globally—high-skill workers benefit the most, while rural and low-income regions lag behind due to limitations in infrastructure and digital access.

### Why This Topic Matters in 2024

Several trends make this research especially relevant:

- Remote job availability has stabilized in tech and professional services but declined in sectors with low digital adaptability.  
- AI-related hiring continues to grow faster than traditional roles.  
- Emerging cities such as Austin and Denver increasingly compete with traditional hubs such as Boston and Silicon Valley.  
- Remote work is reducing concentration of opportunities in a few metropolitan areas and redistributing economic activity more broadly.

### Purpose of This Study

This project analyzes:

- Where AI and non-AI jobs are most concentrated  
- Which U.S. regions exhibit the strongest job growth  
- How remote, hybrid, and onsite positions differ across industries  
- Whether geographic inequities are narrowing or widening  

By examining these patterns, the study aims to provide a clearer understanding of how geography, technology, and job modality interact to shape employability and opportunity in the post-pandemic economy.
