## Introduction and Research Rationale

The topic *“Geographic and Remote Work Analysis”* is highly relevant to understanding
the evolving job market in 2024. The geography of employment has undergone a fundamental
transformation driven by advances in digital technology, the expansion of AI-related
roles, and the normalization of remote work. Understanding how location and job type
interact helps identify which regions are growing, which industries are decentralizing,
and how workers can adapt to the new distribution of opportunities.

This topic is particularly important because it reflects how technology is reshaping
access to employment and income. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a global shift toward
remote and hybrid models, turning work-from-home (WFH) from an optional arrangement
into a structural feature of modern employment (Cheung, Chuang, & Yiu, 2023). This
transition has far-reaching implications for productivity, job accessibility, and
regional development. In some industries, workers have gained new flexibility and
access to high-paying roles regardless of geography, while in others—especially those
that rely on physical presence—the benefits remain limited.

Recent research provides valuable evidence of how remote work is changing the geography
of employment. In New Zealand, Cheung et al. (2023) used location-based service (LBS)
data to visualize how workplaces became geographically dispersed following the pandemic,
confirming that WFH has reshaped urban employment patterns. In the United States,
Althoff, Eckert, Ganapati, and Walsh (2022) found that high-income business service
workers were among the first to transition to remote work, causing spending and consumer
demand to shift away from large cities. This redistribution of human capital and
economic activity suggests that traditional metropolitan hubs like Silicon Valley
and Boston may gradually lose their dominance as new regional centers—such as Austin
and Denver—continue to attract talent and investment. On a global scale, Braesemann
et al. (2022) observed that remote work opportunities remain unevenly distributed
across countries and skill levels, with high-skill workers and high-income regions
benefiting the most, while rural areas lag behind due to limited infrastructure and
digital access.

In 2024, several key trends make this area of study especially crucial. Remote job
availability has stabilized in technology and professional service sectors but declined
in manufacturing and healthcare. AI-related hiring continues to expand faster than
traditional roles, while emerging cities are becoming increasingly competitive alternatives
to long-established tech hubs. These patterns indicate that the geography of work
is becoming fluid—shaped by technology adoption, workforce flexibility, and infrastructure
capacity.

Through this analysis, we expect to identify where AI and non-AI job growth is most
concentrated, and whether remote opportunities are increasing or declining across
industries. We also anticipate finding that while tech hubs remain influential, remote
work is gradually helping to distribute opportunities more evenly across regions.
Ultimately, this research aims to provide insights into how geography, technology,
and job type interact to shape employability and equity in the post-pandemic economy.
